  As a quick tech evaluation I'd like you to use the Twitter streaming API (statuses/sample) to collect 5 minutes of tweets.
 Obtain a total word count, filter out "stop words" (words like "and", "the", "me", etc -- useless words),
 and present the 10 most frequent words in those 5 minutes of tweets.

Please don't copy and paste any code, but of course you can do whatever research necessary.
 Your code should be clear to follow, with explanatory comments where necessary.

Let me know if you have any questions about this (and also please confirm that you understand the project),
 and I look forward to seeing what you come up with!

Optional Part B) How would you implement it so that if you had to stop the program and restart,
 it could pick up from the total word counts that you started from?
